        <h3>Why Protein-First?</h3>
        <p>
          When your week gets busy, protein is usually the first thing to fall off the plate.
          A protein-first approach helps you stay fuller longer, support strength training, and
          avoid the energy crashes that come from low-protein meals and snacks. When I meal prep 
          on Mondays, I keep it practical but intentional. My go-to bowl starts with organic quinoa 
          (a complete protein that contains all nine essential amino acids), roasted garbanzo beans 
          seasoned with cumin and turmeric, and a mix of veggies like zucchini, poblano peppers, 
          yellow squash, and green bean sprouts. I top it all off with homemade avocado salsa for 
          healthy fats and flavor. According to USDA FoodData Central, quinoa provides about 8 grams 
          of protein per cooked cup, while chickpeas pack in around 15 grams per cooked cup 
          (USDA FoodData Central). For me, the combination of textures, colors, and flavors makes it 
          a meal I actually look forward to eating—and that’s half the battle with healthy habits. 
          I also like to roast extra chickpeas on Sunday night so I have a crunchy, protein-packed 
          snack ready for the week.

        <h3>My Go-To Meal Prep Formula</h3>
        <p>
          Think of your meals as a simple template: start with a protein base, add colorful vegetables,
          layer in smart carbs, and finish with healthy fats. This makes it easier to build balanced
          bowls and plates without overthinking every recipe.
