        <h3>Why Small Hacks Matter</h3>
        <p>
          You don’t always have time for a full meal prep day — and that’s okay. Protein-first hacks help you
          make the most of what you already eat by slightly upgrading your choices instead of starting from scratch.
        When your schedule is a hot mess. This topic matters because so many of us are juggling school, work, workouts, and everything in between, and the last thing we need is to crash at 3PM because lunch was just a granola bar. In this article, I want to share a few simple, protein-packed meal ideas that I use myself when the week gets crazy, and I hope you’ll walk away with at least one new idea that makes your life a little easier and healthier.
          Let’s be real—most of us aren’t waking up at 6AM to perfectly portion out grilled chicken and brown rice for the week. But prioritizing protein doesn’t have to be that deep. I’ve learned that just being intentional about one thing—like making sure every meal has a solid protein source—can make a massive difference in how I feel, especially on my busiest days. For example, instead of skipping breakfast or grabbing a sugary muffin, I prep egg muffins or Greek yogurt bowls with protein granola and berries. Both take less than 10 minutes to make and keep me full way longer than cereal ever did. According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, higher protein breakfasts can support better energy levels and help with appetite control throughout the day 
Dinner is usually the meal I’m most tempted to phone in, especially after a long day. But I’ve found a few go-to protein-first meals that take less time to make than it takes to scroll TikTok. One of my favorites is a sheet pan salmon with frozen green beans and sweet potatoes. I toss it all with olive oil and seasoning, throw it in the oven, and boom—20 minutes later, I have a solid dinner (and usually leftovers). Another one is rotisserie chicken tacos with slaw and Greek yogurt “sour cream.” Super easy, high protein, and way cheaper than takeout. A 2022 survey from the International Food Information Council showed that 67% of consumers are trying to eat more protein, but many say time and meal preparation are their biggest barriers. So yeah, you’re not alone if you’re trying to eat better but don’t have hours to meal prep.    
    </p>
    What I’ve learned is that you don’t need to be perfect or spend hours in the kitchen eating in a way that supports your goals. Just putting protein first—whether it’s a breakfast bowl, a sheet pan dinner, or even just having hard-boiled eggs on deck—can be a total game-changer. I’ve felt the difference in my energy, focus, and even recovery from workouts. My goal with this blog series is to keep things simple and real, because good nutrition should work with your life, not against it. Try one or two of these ideas this week, and I promise you’ll feel the shift.
    
        <h3>Breakfast Hacks</h3>
        <p>
          Add Greek-style yogurt or cottage cheese to fruit, sprinkle hemp or chia seeds on oatmeal, or swap sugary
          cereal for eggs with veggies and whole-grain toast. These small shifts can double your morning protein.

        <h3>Lunch & Dinner Hacks</h3>
        <p>
          Keep canned beans, lentils, or chickpeas on hand and add them to salads, soups, and grain bowls. Choose
          tofu, tempeh, or grilled chicken as the base of your plate, then layer on colorful vegetables and healthy fats.
        </p>

        <h3>Snack Hacks</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of chips or cookies, reach for nuts, edamame, hummus with veggies, or a protein smoothie.
          Pairing protein with fiber keeps you fuller for longer and helps prevent energy crashes.
